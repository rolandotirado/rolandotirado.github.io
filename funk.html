     <h1>Funk</h1>
	 <p>Once I heard Flight-Time by Donald Byrd it all started to make sense. A pioneer of Jazz-Funk,
	 here I found a bridge to music that was a direct influence to some of my favorite music as a kid. 
	 I'm also a sucker for a solid base line found in the combination of three elements. The three elements also showed me that "Evil" was the perfect
	 concoction of influences.</p>
