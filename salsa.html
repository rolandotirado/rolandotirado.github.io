     <h1>Salsa</h1>
	 <p>Although the trumpet drove me to new rabbit holes,it was the supporting cast in 
	 Mariachi that keened my focus toward other orchestras. In comes Salsa. In this genre 
	 a similar foundation was discovered with completely different sonics. A new love was 
	 born for music with several instruments, where each is given an opportunity to shine, 
	 unify to create one beautiful sound.</p>
