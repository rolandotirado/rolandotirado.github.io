     <h1>Salsa</h1>
	 <p>Although the trumpet was the catalyst that drove me to new genres of music, 
	 it was the supporting cast that keened my focus toward other orchestras. In comes Salsa. 
	 In this genre of music I found a similar foundation with completely different sonics. 
	 A new found love for music with several components unified to create one beautiful sound, 
	 but still have the opportunity to shine individually, was born.</p>
