     <h1>Songwriting</h1>
	 <p>The best writers come close to describing emotion in words. What I mean by this is emotions are understood
	 through experience rather than instruction. Try explaining anger to someone who's never felt that sensation.
	 You can come close, but full comprehension will not be attained until the emotion is felt. Many Mariachi songwriters 
	 came close to placing emotions in words by coupling it with beautiful melodies. It led me to appreciate disciples 
	 of songwriting and pushed me toward other avenues of literature.
